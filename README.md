Shad is a programming language to run applications almost entirely on the GPU.

It is particularly well suited for graphics applications like games.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

Before considering to use this language, please keep in mind that:

- It is developed by a single person in his spare time.
- The language is very experimental, so it shouldn't be used for production applications.

## Main language features

- üî• Maximize execution on GPU side
- üí™ Strongly typed
- üîÄ Data race free
- üîÑ Hot reloadable

## Supported platforms

- Windows
- Linux
- macOS (limited support because the maintainer doesn't have access to a physical device)
- Android
- Web

Shad may also work on some other platforms, but they have not been tested.

## Getting started

Shad scripts can be run with the following command:

```shell
cargo run --release --bin shad -- run <script path>
```

Examples of Shad scripts are located in the `examples` folder.
